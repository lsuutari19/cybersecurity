# APISEC reconnaissance notes:

## Passive reconnaissance:
	not directly, for example finding documentation about target API, OSINT, endpoints
	These become your target attack surface. Useful information such as OSINT, API_KEYS etc.

	Techniques: 
	- google for information about API, public APIs are easy to find

	- google dorking: search terms such as intitle:"api" site:"<site>"

	- git dorking: search for api repositories for api key exposes, issues etc. extension:json nasa, "authorization: Bearer", filename:swagger.json ...

	- shodan crawling: open ports etc. top countries used, e.x. "content-type: application/json", certificates etc. "wp-json"

	- waybackmachine: search for old documentation; unsupported endpoints finding,
	improper management endpoints that used to exist, that you can search for in the attack. 

## Active reconnaissance:
	interacting directly with the target mainly through the use of scanning
	enumerating open ports, http web applications, API related directories
	tools: nmap, gobuster, kiterunner, devtools etc.

	nmap flags:
		-sC -sV enable default scripts, sevice version detection
		-p- all ports scan
		-p specific port scan

	amass: OSINT collector for endpoints of a site, can be active or passive
		amass enum -active -d crapi.apisec.ai

	gobuster: directory traversal and endpoint finder
		gobuster dir -u <target> -w <wordlist>
		gobuster dir -u <target> -t <int_threads> -w <wordlist> -b <exclude_ports>

	devtools:
		can copy values as cUrl or URL or other format for postman or just normal cUrl
		can right click add columns such as URL for ease of viewing
