## APISEC Scanning APIs notes


### Finding security misconfigurations
**Nikto** is a website and web application vulnerability scanner.

**zaproxy** is a web app scanner that can either manually ur automatically find security vulnerabilities in your web apps during development and is a great tool for manual security testing for penetration testers.

You can import the previously created spec.yml as a OpenAPI definition for more endpoints. You can also use the zaproxy browser for the manual testing, remember to set "attack mode on". Be careful of false positives when using this tool.
